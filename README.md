# Part 2: Changing out the Data

Last week, we created a .csv with airport origins, destinations, and counts. This file required some cleaning to remove US airports not within the states. We have provided you with the resulting .csv, "filteredflights.csv".

+ Replace the current data with this csv in the code.
+ The circles are now hard to discern due to the overlap. Adjust the circle features to better show individual airports.
+ Change the radius of the circle to depend upon number of flights (counts) instead of "links".
+ Adjust how the radius is calculated from the counts for better scaled circles.

# Part 1: Drawing the map

+ The land in this map has no fill. Change the color of the states.
+ What happens if you change the color of the .state-boundaries border? What about the land border?
+ Change the width of the borders.
+ Adjust the zoom of the map.
+ Have the map show counties instead of only states.
